### [Excel - Executive Sales Report and Dashboard](https://github.com/AdeIkhmat/Excel-Projects/blob/c7b92ba309da501a7cdd460030ea04340b520534/Sales%20Data%20Executive%20Reporting.xlsx)

This project is an executive sales report and dashboard. The data was given by [Dataleum](https://dataleum.com/) for the purpose of the project.

Utilized various Microsoft Excel functions, Pivot Tables, and Pivot Charts to compute essential business metrics such as Profit and Revenue from the sales dataset.

These calculations provided crucial insights into the financial performance of the business.

The computed metrics were then visualized in a user-friendly dashboard, facilitating easy interpretation and decision-making for stakeholders.
